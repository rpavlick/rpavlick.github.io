I'm not the "cool" kind of scientist that wears a lab coat and mixes chemicals or plays god with mice. Nor do I spend a lot of time out in the field in far-off places finding long-lost cities or previously undiscovered species. I mainly sit in front of my computer, writing  code and analyzing data/model output. 

So when my Macbook Air went kaput the other day, it put a big dent in my productivity. I took my Macbook over to the IT department and they told me it would take a week or two to fix it. I got a loaner computer in the meantime, but it doesn't have all the tools installed that I use on a daily basis to get things done. In my lessened state of productivity, I started making a list of those software tools and documenting my process of recreating my computing environment.  

When I do get my computer back, I'm planning to start with a fresh install of Mac OSX 10.10, followed by:
