title: Consider again that dot
---

Welcome to my new blog. The name comes from Carl Sagan's reflections about a photograph known as the Pale Blue Dot.

In the late seventies, NASA launched the Voyager space probes to explore the outer planets. In 1990, having 
completed its primary mission, NASA decided to turn Voyager 1 around to take one last picture of Earth. By that time, the spacecraft
was well past the orbit of Pluto, over 40 times farther from Earth than the Earth is from the Sun.

From that distance, Earth is a few pale blue pixels set against an otherwise dark and empty sky. In one of his many books, Sagan asks us to consider the philosophical implications of that image, and what it means for how we treat each other and the Earth.

>From this distant vantage point, the Earth might not seem of any particular interest. But for us, it's different. Consider again that dot. That's here. That's home. That's us. On it everyone you love, everyone you know, everyone you ever heard of, every human being who ever was, lived out their lives. The aggregate of our joy and suffering, thousands of confident religions, ideologies, and economic doctrines, every hunter and forager, every hero and coward, every creator and destroyer of civilization, every king and peasant, every young couple in love, every mother and father, hopeful child, inventor and explorer, every teacher of morals, every corrupt politician, every "superstar," every "supreme leader," every saint and sinner in the history of our species lived there – on a mote of dust suspended in a sunbeam.

>The Earth is a very small stage in a vast cosmic arena. Think of the rivers of blood spilled by all those generals and emperors so that in glory and triumph they could become the momentary masters of a fraction of a dot. Think of the endless cruelties visited by the inhabitants of one corner of this pixel on the scarcely distinguishable inhabitants of some other corner. How frequent their misunderstandings, how eager they are to kill one another, how fervent their hatreds. Our posturings, our imagined self-importance, the delusion that we have some privileged position in the universe, are challenged by this point of pale light. Our planet is a lonely speck in the great enveloping cosmic dark. In our obscurity – in all this vastness – there is no hint that help will come from elsewhere to save us from ourselves.

>The Earth is the only world known, so far, to harbor life. There is nowhere else, at least in the near future, to which our species could migrate. Visit, yes. Settle, not yet. Like it or not, for the moment, the Earth is where we make our stand. It has been said that astronomy is a humbling and character-building experience. There is perhaps no better demonstration of the folly of human conceits than this distant image of our tiny world. To me, it underscores our responsibility to deal more kindly with one another and to preserve and cherish the pale blue dot, the only home we've ever known.

I read this passage for the first time nearly 14 years ago. The words have stuck with me ever since.

I owe a lot to Carl Sagan, his books and particularly his television series, Cosmos, were inspirations along the path that has led me to a career in science.

That path has most recently led me to a postdoc position at the NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory, the birthplace of Voyager.  Among other things, I'm researching the interactions between biodiversity and climate change. 

My work is a small piece of an immense, but in my opinion, solvable puzzle of how we will continue to survive and coexist on the only home we've ever known, the pale blue dot.
