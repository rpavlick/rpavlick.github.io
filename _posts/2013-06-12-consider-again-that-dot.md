title: Consider again that dot
---

Welcome to my new blog. The name comes from Carl Sagan's reflections about a photograph known as the Pale Blue Dot, contained in a book of the same name.

In the late seventies, NASA launched the  Voyager 1 and 2 space probes to explore the outer planets. In 1990, having 
completed its primary mission, NASA decided to turn Voyager 1 around to take one last picture of Earth. By that time, the spacecraft
was well past the orbit of Pluto, over 40 times father from Earth than the Earth is from the Sun.

From that distance, Earth is a few pale blue pixels set against an otherwise dark and empty sky. Sagan asks us to consider the philosophical implications of that image, and what it means for how we treat each other and the Earth.
